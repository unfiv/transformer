# Game Developer Expertise Test: Answers

### 1. What did you work on in the last year mostly?
For the past year, I worked in a team of six focused on developing and maintaining a **Python-based testing framework** for a high-load fintech component within the **Bloomberg distributed network**. 

**My responsibilities included:**
* Managing **CI/CD pipelines** for various modules.
* Overseeing the SDLC of over **4,000 integration tests**.
* Migrating the framework to a new containerization system.
* Debugging flaky tests across dozens of external components.

This role required a deep dive into unfamiliar infrastructures and complex codebases to identify root causes under tight constraints and high-reliability requirements.

### 2. What programming achievement are you most proud of?
I am particularly proud of a balancing system I developed for my own card game back in 2015. 

To solve the challenge of game balance, I "reinvented" integration testing by creating a **Monte Carlo-style simulation** where different AI agents played against each other thousands of times. I used median results and statistical analysis to fine-tune the mechanics. Additionally, I implemented a **deterministic pseudo-randomness system** to ensure reproducibility while maintaining unpredictable AI behavior. 

This data-driven approach significantly improved the game balance and player satisfaction, and it remains one of my most formative engineering experiences.

### 3. Areas of Expertise (Strong vs. Weak Points)
I believe my strongest skills lie in **Project Architecture** and **Gameplay Systems**. I enjoy designing scalable structures where technical implementation meets game design, ensuring that systems are both flexible and robust.

**My technical profile:**
* **Strong Points:** System architecture, gameplay logic, and **BE communication/Analytics** (having developed SDKs for several game studios). 
* **Performance:** I am naturally drawn to **performance optimization**—I enjoy the process of measuring, profiling, and refactoring to eliminate bottlenecks (as demonstrated in the attached technical task).
* **Weak Points:** Specialized areas like **IK (Inverse Kinematics)**, **3D Rigs**, or complex **VFX/Shader writing** are not my primary strengths. 

I prefer to rely on established engine frameworks and tools for these categories, focusing my energy on core logic and overall system integrity.

### 4. Handling Complex Systems & Sticking Points
When facing a complex, undocumented system (like a legacy A/B test logic), my approach is always methodical:

1.  **Impact Analysis:** My first step is a preliminary analysis to understand the scope.
2.  **Communication:** I immediately communicate with stakeholders to manage expectations regarding timelines and potential risks.
3.  **Collaboration:** I am not afraid to ask for help from more experienced colleagues. I believe that timely collaboration is far more efficient than "getting stuck" in isolation, and it often strengthens team bonds.
4.  **Estimation:** If no immediate guidance is available, I double my most conservative estimates to account for a deep dive into the codebase. 

My philosophy is that **every engineering problem is solvable** given enough time and a methodical approach, which has consistently led to successful outcomes in my past projects.
